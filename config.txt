/*
 * Network timeouts.
 * Because of the way this client is written it doesn't need to constantly talk (keep-alive) to the server to make
 * sure it is there. We detect a buggy / overloaded server by the call timeout. The default values will be ok for
 * nearly all cases. If they aren't the pool has most likely overload issues. Low call timeout values are preferable -
 * long timeouts mean that we waste hashes on potentially stale jobs. Connection report will tell you how long the
 * server usually takes to process our calls.
 *
 * call_timeout - How long should we wait for a response from the server before we assume it is dead and drop the connection.
 * retry_time   - How long should we wait before another connection attempt.
 *                Both values are in seconds.
 * giveup_limit - Limit how many times we try to reconnect to the pool. Zero means no limit. Note that stak miners
 *                don't mine while the connection is lost, so your computer's power usage goes down to idle.

 * Output control.
 * Since most people are used to miners printing all the time, that's what we do by default too. This is suboptimal
 * really, since you cannot see errors under pages and pages of text and performance stats. Given that we have internal
 * performance monitors, there is very little reason to spew out pages of text instead of concise reports.
 * Press 'h' (hashrate), 'r' (results) or 'c' (connection) to print reports.
 *
 * verbose_level - 0  - Don't print anything.
 *                 1  - Print intro, connection event, disconnect event
 *                 2  - All of level 1, and new job (block) event if the difficulty is different from the last job
 *                 3  - All of level 1, and new job (block) event in all cases, result submission event.
 *                 4  - All of level 3, and automatic hashrate report printing
 *                 10 - Debug level for developer
 *
 * print_motd    - Display messages from your pool operator in the hashrate result.
